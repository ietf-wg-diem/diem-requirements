1.  Introduction

   Digital emblems are a means for an asset to signal to validating
   entities that it should be protected or treated in a specific way,
   using some normative framework.  The DIEM WG will define a set of
   standards for an architecture that enables discovery and validation
   of digital emblems.  This document lists the requirements that the
   architecture must accommodate.  These requirements were identified
   across different use cases.  Not all use cases share all
   requirements.  We envision an architecture system comprising multiple
   standards, which can be flexibly profiled for different use cases.
   We use the terms "(digital) emblem," "bearer," and "validation" in
   accordance with the DIEM charter as of writing [CHARTER].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Requirements

   The DIEM architecture will allow validators to discover and validate
   digital emblems that are associated with bearers.  This section
   contains the requirements that this architecture will address.  They
   are based on use cases identified thus far (see Section Use Cases),
   but note that not all use cases share all requirements.  We
   categorize these requirements into: requirements on digital emblems
   and their format, on their discovery, on their validation, and other
   requirements.

3.1.  Digital Emblem Requirements

3.1.1.  Digital Emblem Format

   Digital emblems MUST identify their bearer and their kind of digital
   emblem.  Beyond that, digital emblems MAY include other data, for
   example, an issuer or a validity window.  As of writing, the DIEM
   charter requires that digital emblems MUST explicitly identify their
   bearer by a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).

3.1.2.  Emblem Semantics

   Individual use cases MUST specify the semantics of the emblem and the
   bearer.  It must be clearly stated how discovery and validation of a
   digital emblem should inform validator behavior.

3.2.  Discovery Requirements

3.2.1.  Discovery

   Digital emblems MUST specify how validators can check for the
   presence of a digital emblem.  That is, given a potential bearer a
   validator must be able to determine whether it has an associated
   emblem.  For example, verifying whether a FQDN has an emblem
   associated with it could be realized by fetching digital emblem-
   associated records for said FQDN.

3.2.2.  Removable

   Digital emblems MAY require to be removable in that checking for the
   presence of an emblem associated with a bearer results in no emblem.
   Note that checking for emblem presence is independent of its
   validation.  That is, emblems do not count as removed when they
   become invalid.

3.2.3.  Undetectable Validation

   Digital emblem discovery MAY require that bearers, issuers, and
   authorizing parties be unable to detect when an emblem is being
   discovered or validated.  This requirement is motivated by emblems
   that mark its bearer as protected and ask validators to not attack
   the bearer.  If emblem discovery were detectable by the bearer,
   issuer, or by an authorizing party, malicious parties could misuse
   the digital emblem as an intrusion detection system.

3.3.  Validation Requirements

3.3.1.  Validation

   Digital emblems MAY require validation.  Validation MUST support
   verification of all the emblemâ€™s data and its context.  In
   particular, validation MUST ensure that the emblem was issued for the
   respective bearer.  Some use cases MAY use unverified digital
   emblems.

3.3.2.  Authorization

   Digital emblems MAY require authorization by third-parties.  Any
   authorization mechanism MUST account for the possibility of
   compromise of cryptographic key material, for example, by specifying
   revocation mechanisms or using short-lived credentials.  Individual
   profiles MUST standardize a trust model that describes how validators
   can discover authorities and how the system selects authorities.

3.4.  Other Requirements

3.4.1.  Extensible

   The digital emblem architecture should be extensible.  The initial
   work should not preclude future extensions and individual standards
   should be designed as general as possible.

4.  Extensions

   In this section, we sketch how the digital emblem architecture could
   be extended by future standards to accommodate more use cases, but it
   is not a comprehensive list.

4.1.  Data Formats

   Emblems for additional use cases may be defined via new profiles in
   future standards, potentially including new types of atomic data
   elements requiring additional specification.

4.2.  Bearer Discovery

   It may be non-obvious for some use cases to identify the bearer that
   is associated with an asset, and thus impossible to fetch emblems
   associated with that asset.  To accommodate for such use cases, one
   could specify means to discover bearers for different types of
   assets.

4.3.  Implicit Discovery

   An alternative approach to the above problem would be to bind emblems
   implicitly to their bearer.  Implicit binding would identify the
   bearer by the emblem's location.  For example, if emblems were
   distributed via NFC, the bearer could be the asset that the NFC chip
   is attached to.  As of writing, the current charter scope requires
   that digital emblems explicitly identify their bearer, but such
   discovery mechanisms could be investigated in future WG work.

4.4.  Confidentiality

   Some use cases may contain confidential or sensitive data, and may
   require mechanisms to protect such data.  For example, this could be
   realized with encryption of the general emblem data format that will
   be part of the architecture or to only serve emblems over channels
   with access control mechanisms.

4.5.  Proof of Presence

   For some emblems, it may be relevant to track that an emblem has been
   presented.  This could be achieved, for example, by standardizing
   different distributions mechanisms, e.g., using decentralized
   authenticated data structures.

5.  Use Cases

   Different use cases have different requirements.  The purpose of this
   document is to list the requirements that will be addressed with the
   initial architecture.  We believe that the use cases overlap and
   would benefit from a DIEM architecture developed to provide the
   requirements listed above, though some may require additional
   extensions.  We list use cases here so that relevant stakeholders can
   provide input whether their use case would indeed benefit from a DIEM
   architecture, and invite participants to provide use cases or details
   that we have missed.

   [COPY OVER INFORMATIVE LIST OF LINKS]

5.1.  Basel Convention

   Regulates the trans-boundary movement of hazardous wastes.  Use cases
   are functionally identical to OPCW and IAEA.

5.2.  Ramsar Convention on the Wetlands

   The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as
   Waterfowl Habitat "providees the single most global framework for
   intergovernmental cooperation on wetland issues" and it features a
   list of geographic areas designated by Member States.  A digital
   emblem for the geographic areas potentially requires

   *  Indication of location

   *  Access to presence or absence of Ramsar designation of a specified
      location

   *  Textual description

   *  Ability to validate the presence or absence of Ramsar designation

5.3.  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)

   IAEA administers several treaties, especially related to the
   controlled shipment of atomic fuels and wastes across borders.
   Similar use case as OPCW.

5.4.  International Humanitarian Law

   The Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols constitute the
   core of International Humanitarian Law (IHL).  Some assets enjoy
   certain specific protections under IHL, including that they must not
   be attacked, and IHL codifies four types of protective emblems for
   armed conflict, which inform other parties that marked assets benefit
   from one or several of these specific protections:

   *  The emblems of the Red Cross, Red Crescent, and Red Crystal

   *  The Blue Shield emblem

   *  The emblem for the protection of civil defense marks

   *  The dangerous forces emblem

   Digital emblems under IHL could be extended to digital, network-
   connected and network-addressable assets that enjoy aforementioned
   specific protections under IHL.

5.5.  Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)

   Requires protection of Schedule 1 chemicals in transit between
   signatory countries for research, medical, pharmaceutical, or
   protective purposes.  Emblem would identify place, date, and volume
   of production.  Also a need to encrypt the description/
   characteristics of the items for access only by the receiving customs
   agencies and material handlers.  This encryption precludes other
   actors from determining the contents being transported.

5.6.  Press

   Journalists in conflict zones use protective markings that indicate
   their status as a non-combatant.  Digital assets belonging to the
   press could be digitally marked, and protective markings in conflict
   zones could be digitized.

5.7.  United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC)

   UN Model Regulations [UNMODELREGS] includes "Recommendations on the
   Transport of Dangerous Goods."  This includes labeling of items with
   a four digit "UN Number" that indicates the comounds contained
   within, such as chemicals, explosives, flammable liquids, etc.  For
   example, items containing lithium-based batteries are labeled with
   3480 or 3481 and accompanied by a specific "battery mark" emblem.

5.8.  United Nations Peacekeepers

   UN Peacekeepers use protective markings in theater as well as
   facilities associated with the mission.

5.9.  World Customs Organization (WCO)

   Specifies "Harmonized Systems" codes [HARMONIZED] that classify items
   such as livestock, arms and ammunition, chemicals, plastics,
   machinery, foodstuffs, etc.  They also provide a system for labeling
   origin of items and valuation of items, all enforced by numerous
   international trade agreements between individual nations and groups
   of nations.

5.10.  World Health Organization (WHO)

   Similar to the use case of the Red Cross, Red Crystal, and Red
   Crescent.

5.11.  United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)

   Among other things is responsible for the International Plant
   Protection Convention (IPPC) and International Standards for
   Phytosanitary Measures standards including ISPM 15 that requires wood
   packaging materials (pallets, crates, dunnages) to be debarked, heat-
   treated or fumigated with methyl-bromide, and stamped or branded with
   a compliance mark known as a "wheat stamp."

5.12.  World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)

   WIPO administers 26+ treaties with different protections for
   different things.  Brands that are protected under international law
   (e.g., Madrid Protocol) can mark their shipments with an emblem
   allowing customs agents to positively identify legitimate products.

5.13.  International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)

   Requires protection of civil aviation flights and the ability to
   assert that they are not dual-use (i.e., not carrying military
   cargo).  Digital emblem would carry a geographic description of the
   flight plan, its current location, and an indicator of its identity
   (i.e., tail number).  Potential need for the emblem to reference a
   flight manifest.
