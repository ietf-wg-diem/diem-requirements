<section anchor="introduction">
      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>Digital emblems are a means for an asset to signal to validating entities that it should be protected or treated in a specific way, using some normative framework.
The DIEM WG will define a set of standards for an architecture that enables discovery and validation of digital emblems.
This document lists the requirements that the architecture must accommodate.
These requirements were identified across different use cases.
Not all use cases share all requirements.
We envision an architecture system comprising multiple standards, which can be flexibly profiled for different use cases.
We use the terms "(digital) emblem," "bearer," and "validation" in accordance with the DIEM charter as of writing <xref target="CHARTER"/>.</t>

</section>
    <section anchor="requirements">
      <name>Requirements</name>
      <t>The DIEM architecture will allow validators to discover and validate digital emblems that are associated with bearers. This section contains the requirements that this architecture will address. They are based on use cases identified thus far (see Section Use Cases), but note that not all use cases share all requirements. We categorize these requirements into: requirements on digital emblems and their format, on their discovery, on their validation, and other requirements.</t>
      <section anchor="digital-emblem-requirements">
        <name>Digital Emblem Requirements</name>
        <section anchor="digital-emblem-format">
          <name>Digital Emblem Format</name>
          <t>Digital emblems <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> identify their bearer and their kind of digital emblem. Beyond that, digital emblems <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> include other data, for example, an issuer or a validity window. As of writing, the DIEM charter requires that digital emblems <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> explicitly identify their bearer by a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="emblem-semantics">
          <name>Emblem Semantics</name>
          <t>Individual use cases <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> specify the semantics of the emblem and the bearer. It must be clearly stated how discovery and validation of a digital emblem should inform validator behavior.</t>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section anchor="discovery-requirements">
        <name>Discovery Requirements</name>
        <section anchor="discovery">
          <name>Discovery</name>
          <t>Digital emblems <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> specify how validators can check for the presence of a digital emblem. That is, given a potential bearer a validator must be able to determine whether it has an associated emblem. For example, verifying whether a FQDN has an emblem associated with it could be realized by fetching digital emblem-associated records for said FQDN.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="removable">
          <name>Removable</name>
          <t>Digital emblems <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> require to be removable in that checking for the presence of an emblem associated with a bearer results in no emblem.
Note that checking for emblem presence is independent of its validation.
That is, emblems do not count as removed when they become invalid.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="undetectable-validation">
          <name>Undetectable Validation</name>
          <t>Digital emblem discovery <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> require that bearers, issuers, and authorizing parties be unable to detect when an emblem is being discovered or validated.
This requirement is motivated by emblems that mark its bearer as protected and ask validators to not attack the bearer.
If emblem discovery were detectable by the bearer, issuer, or by an authorizing party, malicious parties could misuse the digital emblem as an intrusion detection system.</t>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section anchor="validation-requirements">
        <name>Validation Requirements</name>
        <section anchor="validation">
          <name>Validation</name>
          <t>Digital emblems <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> require validation. Validation <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support verification of all the emblem's data and its context.
In particular, validation <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ensure that the emblem was issued for the respective bearer.
Some use cases <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use unverified digital emblems.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="authorization">
          <name>Authorization</name>
          <t>Digital emblems <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> require authorization by third-parties.
Any authorization mechanism <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> account for the possibility of compromise of cryptographic key material, for example, by specifying revocation mechanisms or using short-lived credentials.
Individual profiles <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> standardize a trust model that describes how validators can discover authorities and how the system selects authorities.</t>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section anchor="other-requirements">
        <name>Other Requirements</name>
        <section anchor="extensibility">
          <name>Extensibility</name>
          <t>The digital emblem architecture should be extensible.
The initial work should not preclude future extensions and individual standards should be designed as general as possible.</t>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section anchor="extensions">
      <name>Extensions</name>
      <t>In this section, we sketch how the digital emblem architecture could be extended by future standards to accommodate more use cases, but it is not a comprehensive list.</t>
      <section anchor="data-formats">
        <name>Data Formats</name>
        <t>Emblems for additional use cases may be defined via new profiles in future standards, potentially including new types of atomic data elements requiring additional specification.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="bearer-discovery">
        <name>Bearer Discovery</name>
        <t>It may be non-obvious for some use cases to identify the bearer that is associated with an asset, and thus impossible to fetch emblems associated with that asset.
To accommodate for such use cases, one could specify means to discover bearers for different types of assets.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="implicit-discovery">
        <name>Implicit Discovery</name>
        <t>An alternative approach to the above problem would be to bind emblems implicitly to their bearer.
Implicit binding would identify the bearer by the emblem's location.
For example, if emblems were distributed via NFC, the bearer could be the asset to which the NFC chip was attached.
As of this writing, the current charter scope requires that digital emblems explicitly identify their bearer, but such discovery mechanisms could be investigated in future WG work.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="confidentiality">
        <name>Confidentiality</name>
        <t>Some use cases may contain confidential or sensitive data, and may require mechanisms to protect such data.
For example, this could be realized with encryption of the general emblem data format that will be part of the architecture or by only serving emblems over channels with access control mechanisms.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="proof-of-presence">
        <name>Proof of Presence</name>
        <t>For some emblems, it may be relevant to track that an emblem has been presented. This could be achieved, for example, by standardizing different distributions mechanisms, e.g., using decentralized authenticated data structures.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section anchor="use-cases">
      <name>Use Cases</name>
      <t>Different use cases have different requirements.
The purpose of this document is to list the requirements that will be addressed with the initial architecture.
The use cases overlap and would benefit from a DIEM architecture developed to provide the requirements listed above, though some may require additional extensions.
We alphabetically list use cases here so that relevant stakeholders can provide input whether their use case would indeed benefit from a DIEM architecture, and invite participants to provide use cases or details that we have missed.</t>

Some assets enjoy certain specific protections under IHL, including that they must not be attacked, and IHL codifies four types of protective emblems for armed conflict, which inform other parties that marked assets benefit from one or several of these specific protections:</t>
