I don't find it to define anything. In the charter, this is not a problem, because we don't say: \"Look, here we define what an emblem is.\" It's informal and glue text. This changes, however, if we copy-paste these passages into the document.\r\n\r\nLet's look at what the definition says from a more abstract point of view:\r\n\r\n> Emblems such as [...] can be [X]. Emblems can also be [Y].\r\n\r\nThe three sentences after that are more a problem statement that I would rather keep in the charter. These two sentences don't define anything, they only give examples of emblems.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have two, contradictory goals:\r\n\r\n- Have unambiguous terminology.\r\n- Don't spend much time discussing what \"digital emblems\" are.\r\n\r\nWe already spent a long time during chartering trying to define digital emblems, and my feeling is that little came out of that. And I would rather sacrifice ambiguous terminology than having to spent a long time defining digital emblems.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Is it really necessary to have a definition of digital emblems that encompass everything ever brought to the WG?",
