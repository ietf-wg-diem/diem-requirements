Digital Emblems do not actively stop/defend against attacks: For emblems that indicate an asset's protected status, digital emblems can at best serve as a deterrent for attack - as there is no guarantee a would-be attacker will respect the laws, agreements or standards granting the asset its status. \n\n2. Plausible deniability surrounding whether or not emblem was seen, visible or verifiable at time of validation.\n\nNote: This is by no means intended to be an exhaustive list of topics but rather a first brainstorm.
